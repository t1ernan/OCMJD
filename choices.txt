 General Considerations/Assumptions: 
 * The provided data file contains valid data, therefore no validation of the existing data file records is required. Only new/modified data will be validated before being written to the database.
 * The string encoding format,8 bit US ASCII, will not change in the future and therefore will not need to be configurable. It will be hard-coded into the application as a constant value.
 * The application does not need to support localization, as there has been no mention of Bodgitt & Scarper, LLC. being an international company. The only locale supported shall be en_US.
