 Patterns Used: DTO, Singleton, Factory, Delegation,
 
 Assumptions: The provided data file contains valid data, therefore no validation of the existing data file records is required. Only new and modified data will be validated before being written to the database.
 Assumptions: The string encoding format will not change and therefore will not need to be configurable. It will be hardcoded into the application as a constant value.
 Assumptions: The application does not need to support localization, as their has been no mention of Bodgitt & Scarper being an international company. The only locale supported shall be en_US.
 
 Data.java
 Decision: Synchronize every method
 Reason: Simplicity of thread safety
 
 Data.java
 Decision: Delegates responsibility or writing/reading to the database file out to the new class DBFileAccessManager.java
 Reason: Removes the tight coupling of the Data class and the type of database being used. This way if the database is changed to a relational database in the future only the
 
 DBFileAccessManager.java
 Decision: Don't validate the data when writing it to the file. 
 Reason: Since the writing to the file is done on shutdown, if the data is corrupt then there will be no chance to notify the user or fix the issue. These checks should be done before updating records in the cache, preferably at the UI level. This way we can notify the user to amend the record before retrying.
 
 Contractor.java
 Decision: Don't validate the data for each field.
 Reason: Assuming the datafile has valid data, it will be sufficient to perform validation of the data in the UI layer. 
 
 ContractorPK.java
 Decision: Used a ContractorPK object
 Reason: Assuming the datafile has valid data, it will be sufficient to perform validation of the data in the UI layer.
 
 DBMainExtended.java
 Decision: Extended existing interface
 Reason: Stop throwing RecordNotFoundException for some methods.
